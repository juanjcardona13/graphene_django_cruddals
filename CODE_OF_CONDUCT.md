To ensure that all reports of code of conduct violations are handled fairly and promptly, we have established the following reporting mechanism:

1. **Incident Reporting:** Each report received will be logged confidentially by our conflict resolution team.

2. **Investigation:** Our team will conduct an impartial and thorough investigation into each report to determine its accuracy and severity.

3. **Corrective Actions:** Depending on the severity of the violation, appropriate measures will be taken, which may include warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.

4. **Communication:** Feedback will be provided to the individual who made the report regarding the actions taken and any necessary follow-up.

5. **Continuous Monitoring:** The conflict resolution team will continuously monitor reports to ensure they are effectively addressed and to identify any patterns of problematic behavior.

## üö® Violation Action Procedure 

In the event that someone violates our code of conduct, we will take action to address the situation as follows:

1. **Private Warning:** A private warning will be issued to the individual who has violated the code of conduct. This warning will be friendly yet clear, providing guidance on how to correct the behavior.

2. **Second Warning:** If the individual does not respond appropriately to the first private warning and continues to violate the code of conduct, a second warning will be issued. This time, the warning will be made publicly, with the aim of reminding the entire community of the importance of the code of conduct and encouraging a constructive conversation about maintaining a respectful and welcoming environment.

3. **Temporary Suspension:** In cases of repeated or serious violations, and if previous warnings are not heeded, a temporary suspension may be imposed. During this time, the individual will not be able to actively participate in the CRUDDALS community.

4. **Permanent Ban:** If violations persist or are particularly severe, and if there is no adequate response to previous measures, it may result in a permanent ban from participating in the CRUDDALS community.
